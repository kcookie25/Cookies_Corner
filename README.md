Welcome to Cookie's Corner! This page was built to help students in my classroom navigate next steps once they are finished with classwork.  
There are FIVE different steps: 
1. How are you doing today? which allows students a chance to take a break and think about how they are doing using fun emojis.
2. Check Powerschool, which is our LMS.
3. Grade check.  Students can input a percentage, and I will tell them what letter grade they currently have.  This is based on the grade scale at the high school where I teach.
4. What's next? Students can click for random ideas of what they can do next while in the classroom.
5. Don't forget about the Cookie Chat! You can send a question or message to me, and then be redirected to another page with further instructions.

My CSS features include:
-Using Flexbox and CSS Grid to rearrange the content on my page.  On mobile screens I used Flexbox with everything in 1 column.  On medium screens, I used CSS Grid and split my
elements into two columns.  On large screens, I used Flexbox and centered all elements into one row.
-Using the "nth-child" and transform property to rotate every other emoji 180 degrees.  This applies to the emojis.  The neutral and dissatisfied emojies are flipped upside down.

My JavaScript features include:
-Creating a grade check that students MUST input a number between 0 - 100 to run a conditional statement that will tell them what letter grade they currently have. (for example..
a student inputs a 75, a C would return)
-Creating a what's next function, which randomizes an array of tasks a student can do once they have completed their classwork.
-Creating drop down divs, which are initially hidden and show when the post it image is clicked.
-Creating a Cookie Chat where the value is passed through the form, and is read from the URL to display their question in alert form.
